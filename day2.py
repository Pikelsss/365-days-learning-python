# For example
is_student = True
print("Boolean:", is_student)
# Result: Boolean: True
# What about false in boolean?
# Where can we use this?
# We can use it to check if something is false, like if a student is not enrolled in a course.
# For example
is_student = False
print("Boolean:", is_student)
# Result: Boolean: False

# Next is List
# What is List?
# List is a collection of items.
# Where can we use this?
# We can use it to store multiple values, like a list of students in a class.
# For example
students = ["James", "Kaizer", "Mc"]
print("List:", students)
# Result: List: ['James', 'Kaizer', 'Mc']

# Next is Tuple
# What is Tuple?
# Tuple is a collection of items that cannot be changed.
# Where can we use this?
# We can use it to store multiple values that should not be changed, like the coordinates of a point.
# For example
coordinates = (10, 20)
print("Tuple:", coordinates)
# Result: Tuple: (10, 20)

# Next is Dictionary
# What is Dictionary?
# Dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs.
# Where can we use this?
# We can use it to store data in a structured way, like a phone book.
# For example
phone_book = {"James": "123-456-7890", "Kaizer": "987-654-3210", "Mc": "555-555-5555"}
print("Dictionary:", phone_book)
# Result: Dictionary: {'James': '123-456-7890', 'Kaizer': '987-654-3210', 'Mc': '555-555-5555'}
# What about empty dictionary?
# Where can we use this?
# We can use it to store data in a structured way, like a phone book.
# For example
empty_dict = {}
print("Empty Dictionary:", empty_dict)
# Result: Empty Dictionary: {}

# Next is Set
# What is Set?
# Set is a collection of unique items.
# Where can we use this?
# We can use it to store unique values, like a list of unique students in a class.
# For example
unique_students = {"James", "Kaizer", "Mc", "James"}
print("Set:", unique_students)
# Result: Set: {'James', 'Kaizer', 'Mc'}
# What about empty set?
# Where can we use this?
# We can use it to store unique values, like a list of unique students in a class.
# For example
empty_set = set()
print("Empty Set:", empty_set)
# Result: Empty Set: set()
