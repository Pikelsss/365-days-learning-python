# lets define two numbers to do some basic math in python
a = 5
b = 10

# Addition
# what does it do?
# it adds two numbers
# what is the result?
# it is 15

sum_result = a + b
print("Addition", sum_result)

# Subtraction
# what does it do?
# it subtracts two numbers
# what is the result?
# it is -5
difference = a - b
print("Subtraction", difference)
# you can also use sub_result = a - b
# but it is not recommended
# because it is not clear what it does
# it is better to use difference = a - b
# it is more clear what it does

# Multiplication
# what does it do?
# it multiplies two numbers
# what is the result?
# it is 50
product = a * b
print("Multiplication", product)
# you can also use prod_result = a * b
# but it is not recommended
# because it is not clear what it does
# it is better to use product = a * b
# it is more clear what it does

# Division
# what does it do?
# it divides two numbers
# what is the result?
# it is 0.5
quotient = a / b
print("Division", quotient)
# you can also use div_result = a / b
# but it is not recommended
# because it is not clear what it does
# it is better to use quotient = a / b
# it is more clear what it does
